          possible legal violations at the time the link was set and were free
          of illegal content at the time the link was set. A constant review of
          the content of the external links is not possible without concrete
          evidence of an infringement. In the case of direct or indirect links

          liability would only exist if we became aware of the content and it
          was technically possible and reasonable for us to prevent use in the
